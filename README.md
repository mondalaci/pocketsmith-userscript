# PocketSmith userscript

This userscript
- Extends session timeout by keeping the session alive for as long as PocketSmith is opened. The default session timeout is merely half hour long.
- Makes the user interface more compact, allowing for about twice as many transaction to fit on the screen than in compact mode:
